## Our Topic : **Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain to Enhance Earthquake Prediction and Response Systems**
## Interdisciplinary Problem & Context
### Problem & Challeneges
#### Data and Prediction Challenges:​
- Data Scarcity and Quality​
- Model Generalizability​
- Computational Demands​
#### Blockchain and System Integration Issues:​
- Scalability and Latency​
- Privacy and Security​
- Interoperability and Collaboration​
#### Social and Practical Barriers:
- Data Management and Curation​
- Resource Constraints​
### Context
- Earthquake Impact: it can cause massive damage to infrastructure leading to loss of lives and its random occurrence makes it difficult to take precaution. Urban areas are more prone to such disasters. [1][4][5]​
- Current Limitation: the response time for such disaster manage is very slow due to damaged infrastructure. This can lead to more lives being lost as critical aid is delayed and, also it can lead to reduced trust between stakeholders. [1][2][5]
## Objectives (Aims)
- Increase earthquake precursor detection accuracy by 15–25% using AI models trained on seismic waveform patterns.​
- Reduce alert dissemination time by 40–60% using blockchain-based verification and message broadcasting.​
- Achieve 100% traceability for response actions, sensor updates, and resource deployment through a shared ledger.​
