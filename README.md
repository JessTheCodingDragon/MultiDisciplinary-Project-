## Interdisciplinary Problem & Context
Disaster prediction and response systems face major challenges: fragmented data, lack of real-time integration, limited scalability, privacy concerns, and poor transparency in resource allocation. Traditional systems struggle to process massive, heterogeneous data streams and coordinate among diverse stakeholders, leading to delays, inefficiencies, and resource mismanagement during disasters. The integration of AI and blockchain is proposed to overcome these barriers by enabling accurate predictions, secure data sharing, and transparent, accountable operations across the disaster management lifecycle 131713.

AI technologies—such as machine learning, deep learning, and predictive analytics—can process real-time sensor and social data to forecast disasters and optimize emergency responses. Blockchain, with its decentralized, tamper-proof, and transparent ledger, addresses issues of data integrity, traceability, and trust among multiple agencies and organizations. The convergence of these technologies is inherently interdisciplinary, requiring expertise in data science, cybersecurity, logistics, emergency management, and policy to design, implement, and govern robust disaster management solutions 1317134.

## Context
>> Increasing Disaster Frequency and Complexity: Natural and man-made disasters are becoming more frequent and severe, demanding advanced, scalable, and adaptive management systems 1313.
>> Data Explosion: The proliferation of IoT devices and social media generates vast, multi-modal data streams, necessitating AI for real-time analysis and blockchain for secure, transparent data management 1317.
>> Stakeholder Coordination: Effective disaster response requires seamless collaboration among governments, NGOs, private sector, and affected communities, which is often hindered by siloed systems and lack of trust 3174.

## Objectives (Aims)
>> Develop Scalable, Real-Time Disaster Prediction Systems: Leverage AI and IoT to enable accurate, timely forecasting and early warning for diverse disaster scenarios 1133.
>> Enhance Transparency and Trust in Resource Allocation: Use blockchain to ensure secure, auditable, and equitable distribution of resources and information among stakeholders during disaster response 3171.
>> Facilitate Interoperable, Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing: Integrate federated learning and blockchain to allow collaborative model training and data exchange without compromising privacy or security 117.
